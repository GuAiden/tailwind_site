        The Actuarial Society of UNSW (ASOC) is a student society which is
        tailored to provide support for actuarial students on campus in their
        challenging but rewarding experience at university. As a constituent
        club of the university, it is supported by Arc, the Faculty of Business
        and the School of Actuarial Studies. <br />
        <br /> Our vision is “To guide and facilitate a supportive, social and
        united actuarial student community on campus”, a principle that shapes
        the general running and purpose of our society. <br /> <br />
        The ASOC experience can also be summed up by our motto: Aspirations,
        Support, Opportunities, Community, as we believe that these four words
        derive the essence of what students can expect from our society. <br />
        <br /> ASOC is one of the most highly regarded actuarial student
        societies in Australia and is also one of the most active clubs in UNSW
        Sydney in terms of activities and support for our members. We provide a
        wide range of events throughout the year, in four major areas: social;
        sporting; academic; and careers. These involve events such as a
        mentoring program, PASS classes, inter-university sporting competitions,
        BBQs, career seminars, camp, an annual ball and many more. We also
        produce a monthly publication for members and pride ourselves on
        developing an active network of volunteers which allows members to
        develop skills, get involved in campus life, and have a sense of
        ownership in our activities. Moreoever, the latest news, snapshots and
        reviews of our fantastic events are published in our regular Finity
        Actuarial Bulletin. <br />
        <br />
        All students currently in the process of completing either: a major or
        minor in actuarial studies; or undertaking an actuarial subject or
        mathematics for actuarial and finance are automatic members of the
        society. Others wishing to join the society may become associate members
        by paying an annual membership fee. <br />
        <br /> We welcome all students to join ASOC and be a part of our
        wonderful events. It is a great chance to network with peer future
        actuaries. We look forward to seeing you on board in fantastic actuarial
        journey with us!
